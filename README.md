# Face-recognition-Attendance-System-Project

### Abstract 

Recent advances in deep learning have made tasks such as Image and speech recognition possible. We are going to teach the computer to recognize particular objects. By using this technique, we aim to recognize human faces from a camera which can probably be used to calculate the attendance in a classroom. 
 
For training we used a Machine Learning approach called supervised learning and for classification we used the concept of openCV cascade classifiers and created an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). We have packaged everything into a user-friendly Android Application to make the attendance procedure very easier. The Application is very simple to use for various users, be it Teacher, Student or Admin and also to access the Information users want to see—the way they’d prefer to see it

### Details :

Everyday actions are increasingly being handled electronically, instead of with pencil and paper or face to face. This growth in electronic transactions has resulted in a greater demand for fast and accurate user identification and authentication. Be it educational institutions or the IT industry, attendance monitoring of the candidates is a must for performance evaluation. Keeping that in mind, the attendance evaluation has to be efficient and appropriate. The manual attendance system is time consuming and not accurate always. With the recent advances in technology, attendance mechanisms such as bio-metric attendance proved to be better than the manual system in terms of the ease of use and efficiency but it is rather an expensive mechanism. With our learnings, we have made an attempt to make the attendance system cost efficient and easier for use. We have used Face Detection as our metric for attendance by using the latest ML features and the efficient results are being displayed in a user-friendly app which has different views of operation for both the admin and the candidate. By adding a creative touch, we tried to make the mechanism interesting for both the admin and the candidate resulting in efficient results.
